hall still quiet though people stood row face looking towards podium listening observed noise side hall quietness even allowed individual rank go forward faction people left faction fewer number right probably important although behaviour calmer made seem like k began speak convinced way question lord whether house painter fact even ask merely imposed symptomatic whole way proceeding carried perhaps object proceeding quite right proceeding acknowledge moment acknowledge pity large extent impossible observe business without feeling pity nt thing done without due care would like make clear make acknowledgement k stopped speaking looked hall spoken sharply sharply intended quite right rewarded applause everything quiet clearly waiting would follow perhaps quietness laying ground outbreak activity would bring whole affair end somewhat disturbing door end hall opened young washerwoman seemed finished work came despite caution attracted attention people judge gave k direct pleasure

capable anyway sure examining judge speak far better part job want public discussion public wrong listen day ago placed arrest arrest something laugh beside point came morning still bed maybe order given arrest house painter seems possible judge someone innocent chose police thug occupying next room could taken better precaution dangerous robber policeman unprincipled riffraff talked till sick

benefit either feel matter chance idea came even without explanation soon come realise done already futility idea answer although quite right consider advantageous matter made perfectly clear give

assertion sort passed father quite unassailable take assertion round judge know start currently painting put assertion come sitting evening ill lay assertion front explain innocent give personal guarantee superficial guarantee real binding painter eye seemed show reproach k wanting impose sort responsibility would kind k would judge believe nonetheless pas absolute acquittal like answered painter anyway entirely sure judge would believe many instance might want bring see personally come along least happens matter half way especially teach advance exactly need act judge concerned course also happens though judge wholl turn advance worse certainly make several attempt still forget least afford judge pas decisive verdict got enough judge signature document take judge concerned case might even signature already case thing develop bit quicker would otherwise nt usually many hold ups time defendant feel confident odd true people feel confidence time acquitted particular exertion needed document asserting defendant innocence guaranteed number judge judge acquit without worry although still several formality gone doubt hell favour several acquaintance however walk court free free k hesitantly right painter apparently free put better way temporarily free junior judge one know nt right give final acquittal highest judge court quite reach u nt know thing look incidentally nt want know right acquit people major privilege judge nt right free people indictment theyre freed way time charge withdrawn still hanging head take order higher bring back force good contact court also tell difference absolute apparent acquittal described superficial way directive court office absolute acquittal proceeding stop everything disappears process indictment trial even acquittal disappears everything disappears apparent acquittal different happens nothing changed except case innocence acquittal ground acquittal made stronger apart proceeding go court office continue business case get passed higher court get passed back lower court backwards forward sometimes faster sometimes slower fro impossible know exactly happening going seen outside sometimes seem everything long since forgotten document lost acquittal complete noone familiar court would believe document ever get lost court forgets nothing day noone expects judge pick document look closely notice particular case still active order defendant immediate arrest talking long delay apparent acquittal rearrest quite possible know case like likely defendant go home acquitted find somebody waiting rearrest course life free man end trial start asked k finding hard believe trial always start painter possibility getting apparent acquittal accused muster strength must nt give painter last phrase possibly result impression k whose shoulder dropped somewhat gave get second acquittal asked k anticipation revelation painter harder get first time far concerned answered painter nothing certain mean second arrest would adverse influence judge verdict pass defendant happens acquittal passed judge already aware rearrest likely happens hardly effect countless reason judge mood legal acumen case altered effort obtain second acquittal must therefore suited new condition generally vigorous first second acquittal final k shaking head course painter second acquittal followed third arrest third acquittal fourth arrest meant term apparent acquittal k silent clearly nt think apparent acquittal offer much advantage painter perhaps deferment would suit better would like explain deferment k nodded painter leant back spread chair nightshirt wide open pushed hand inside stroking breast side deferment painter looking vaguely front trying find perfectly appropriate explanation deferment consists keeping proceeding permanently earliest stage accused helping need keep continuous personal contact court especially helping repeat nt require much effort getting apparent acquittal probably requires lot attention must never let trial sight go see appropriate judge regular interval well something particular come whatever try remain friendly nt know judge personally influence judge know without giving direct discussion long nt fail thing reasonably sure trial wo nt get past first stage trial nt stop defendant almost certain avoiding conviction acquitted compared apparent acquittal deferment advantage defendant future le uncertain safe shock suddenly rearrested nt need fear exertion stress involved getting apparent acquittal everything else life would make difficult deferment certain disadvantage though nt underestimated nt mean defendant never free never free proper sense word apparent acquittal either another disadvantage proceeding ca nt prevented moving forward unless least ostensible reason given something need seem happening looked outside mean time time various injunction obeyed accused questioned investigation take place trial artificially constrained inside tiny
